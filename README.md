There are two (2) modes and each button has a unique icon, tone, and color
![buttons work and different modes](https://github.com/TylerM2230/simple-memory-game/blob/main/featuresOne.gif) 
Different modes change number of attempts. Each round has a unique pattern and a limited time to enter guess
![attempts change and counter](https://github.com/TylerM2230/simple-memory-game/blob/main/featuresTwo.gif)
